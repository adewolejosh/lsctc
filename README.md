LSCTC

#### originally termed (Lagos State Central Transportation Control) 

## Concept 
Basically, as the term implies it was supposed to be a project that helps a large
organisation in this case, a state, Lagos State to keep track of the amount of
transportation vehicles in the state and also to help in the facilitating of 
digital remitting of money, thereby eradicating street thugs from collecting money
supposed to boost the economy. Well, that was the original Idea! But right now, I
see it more like a general structure for a data collection system and not just for
a particular thing. I also considered using this for a game which I may term "My
Little Big City" whereby a group of people run a virtual city. Well, you get the
idea, I guess.

One thing worthy of Note is the fact that I am very much trying to use this
project to try out several neat and clean Django Patterns and Design based on the
book, "Best Practices and Design Patterns in Django" as well as for Nodejs

## Setup
There are two servers running, Python's Django and JavaScript's Node;  
Reasons:  
High level layer - Django  
Low level layer and data processing - Node
